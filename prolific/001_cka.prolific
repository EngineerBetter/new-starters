I have an idea how much of the CKA syllabus I know

Do one of the mock exams in the [Certified Kubernetes Administrator Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/certified-kubernetes-administrator-with-practice-tests/), and log your score in a comment on this story. If you have several attempts, it'd be lovely to see your progress, so please add subsequent scores.

This process is a matter of benchmarking rather than pass/fail - it allows us to figure out where people are with their learning, so don't worry if it doesn't go well.

L: training, kubernetes, cka
