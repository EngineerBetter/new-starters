I understand what to do with this backlog

Get your onboarding guide to explain to you what this is all about.

## Acceptance

* Explain to your guide what you need to do
* Observe all stories in the backlog are pointed

---

I know where to find things

Read the [new-starters](https://github.com/EngineerBetter/new-starters) repository.

---

I can get paid

Make a copy of the [New Employee Record Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PW7BJYmm3blKpUKtFMZcoyBJ5EeNBvjsC5hgVpuYhgw/edit), naming your copy `New Employee Record - Your Name`. You should share the document with Ivana Scott.

This is so that we can set up your payroll profile on FreeAgent and so that we can set you up on our bank account as a beneficiary.

I have discussed how things work with Ivana

Ensure that a meeting with Ivana is scheduled, and then attend that meeting, to cover all the 'people' things including:

* how to book time off
* what benefits are available
* pension
* share options
* payroll
* team communication
* company meetings
* reviews
* any questions you may have

You may wish to [skim the employee documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1qKZKCuIK9jF_skUv5R0mF7f9MoSYxu8e) before the meeting.

This story is done when the meeting has taken place. Whilst waiting for the meeting, you may wish to add `Waiting for meeting` as a blocker.

---

I have been invited to think about how I can improve

Read the [introspection](https://github.com/EngineerBetter/introspection) repository.

---

I understand that I should use a face photo for my work profiles/avatars

If you've read this far, then this story is done :) We prefer face photos in order to avoid confusion and encourage as personal an atmosphere as possible. We don't list all the tools that you should upload a profile photo to as the list will become a documentation burden.

---

I understand that my usernames should be my 'in-person' name

We'd like it if you chose usernames that are the same as your real-life 'handle' - ie what you'd like people to refer to you as in an in-person conversation. For most people this will be their actual name, or an abbreviation. Our ex-colleague Panagiotis was "Panos" to save his ears from poor pronunciation; Daniel Jones is "Deejay" because we used to have multiple Daniels.

What we'd rather avoid are handles like `l33tn00bki113rMAXHAXX0r` or something.

If you've read this far, then this story is done :)
